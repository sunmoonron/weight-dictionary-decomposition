Every number in the paper is written by one of these scripts into `results/<script>.json`, with the run log in `logs/`. Scripts are self-contained: each loads the public checkpoint it names, builds the dictionary, runs the experiment and writes JSON. Models in the paper: GPT-2 small, SmolLM2-135M, Qwen2.5-0.5B, Pythia-410m, OLMo-1B, Qwen2.5-7B, Pythia-6.9B and Llama-7B; a few early scripts also load GPT-2 medium. Corpora: WikiText-2 (train split for centering and data controls, held-out split for evaluation) and a Pile-derived sample. A single 8 GB GPU or a CPU suffices; the longest scripts take a few hours on CPU.

Environment: Python 3.11, torch 2.x, transformers 4.46 or 5.x, numpy, scipy. No API keys, no network beyond downloading checkpoints.

## Running the scripts

Every script writes its JSON to `results/` next to `scripts/` by default and reads checkpoints from the standard Hugging Face cache. Environment variables:

- `WDD_RESULTS`: directory for the JSON results (default `../results` relative to the script).
- `HF_HOME`: Hugging Face cache; if unset the default cache is used. The scripts only pin a cache path when the original machine's directory exists.
- `WDD_MODELS`: comma-separated subset of model keys for `exp_s9_families.py` and `exp_x2_families_attrib.py` (default: all).
- `WDD_N_NOM`: nominees per arm for `exp_x3_bakeoff2.py` (10 reproduces the run in the paper; 30 writes `exp_x3_bakeoff2_n30.json`).
- `WDD_SW_DETECTION`: optional path to a channel list from a separate super-weight study; `exp_s9_families.py` runs without it and the paper does not use it.
- `WDD_CORPORA`: comma-separated subset of `wikitext,pile` for `exp_z2_ci.py` (default: both).
- `WDD_OMP_BATCH`: states per OMP batch in `exp_z2_ci.py` (default 2048; 1024 lets two 7B jobs share one 80 GB card).

The 7B-class rows of the family sweep (`qwen2.5-7b`, `pythia-6.9b`, `llama-7b`) load the checkpoint in bfloat16 and need a GPU with about 40 GB of memory; the sub-1B rows fit an 8 GB GPU.

- `exp_x4_crossdomain.py`: X4: cross-domain check of the core GPT-2 numbers on a non-Wikipedia corpus. Corpus fallback chain: NeelNanda/pile-10k -> HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu (streaming). 

## sec 4.2 attribution and observability

- `exp_c_validate.py`: Experiment C: does WDD recover the TRUE computation?
- `exp_f_recovery.py`: Experiment F: write recovery WITHOUT selection bias, and confound controls.
- `exp_h_clusters.py`: Experiment H: cluster-level attribution.
- `exp_i_observability.py`: Experiment I: observability -- predicting WHICH writes are recoverable.
- `exp_j_transform.py`: Experiment J: transformation vs erasure -- and who erases block 3.
- `exp_j_rerun.py`: Experiment J RERUN -- transformation vs erasure, with the two audit fixes.
- `exp_j2_depth.py`: Experiment J2: case-level depth tracking of the genuinely erased writes.

- `exp_r7b_usedinfo.py`: R7: ERASED BUT USED? -- does the model's downstream computation still consume a write whose direction is gone from the residual stream?

## sec 4.3 generality

- `exp_s9_families.py`: Write Dynamics Ep.5 / generality sweep: WDD across model families.
- `exp_x2_families_attrib.py`: """X2: per-family attribution deep-dive + channel-robust FVU.
- `exp_x9_top1conc.py`: X9: concentration of the largest true write per token (how often the top write is the same neuron), for reading the 7B recalls.
- `exp_z2_ci.py`: the sweep of Table 1 as a second implementation written from the paper's description: eight models, WikiText-2 and the Pile sample, 32,768 states per model and corpus, weight/rotated/random dictionaries, OMP and one-shot attribution against the ledger, within-decile correlations, and 95% bootstrap intervals over the 64 evaluation sequences (`exp_z2_ci.json`; per-token records in `exp_z2_tokens/`; logs in `logs/z2/`). Resume-safe per model/corpus key.
- `exp_z2_recompute.py`: recomputes the reconstruction metrics of `exp_z2_ci.json` from the saved per-token records without a GPU and adds the sink-state convention: states above ten times the median norm (one or two per sequence, 59 to 99% of the variance) are reported separately (`*_sink`) from the typical states (`*_typical`). Table 1 and Appendix I use the typical-state metrics.
- `exp_z3_ceiling.py`: the observability analysis of `exp_i_observability.py` for all eight models on both corpora (survival bins, one-property AUCs, a miss decomposition into erased, weakened, twin and intact-unselected, support composition), with bootstrap intervals; per-case arrays in `exp_z3_cases/`.
- `exp_z4_sae.py`: the trained SAE of Bloom (2024), loaded from its published weights in the TransformerLens frame, against the weight dictionary on identical GPT-2 states in four cells (WikiText-2 at 512 tokens and OpenWebText at 128 tokens, after block 5 and after block 6), with L0, FVU on typical states and spliced-in cross-entropy for both.
- `exp_z5_kcurve.py`: FVU against k for the weight dictionary and its rotation on 8,192 WikiText-2 states per model, at k = 4 to 256 and at k = d/16 and d/12, with per-token records in `exp_z5_tokens/` so the typical-state curves can be computed.
- `wdd_z_common.py`: the shared state, ledger and dictionary construction used by the three scripts above (lifted from `exp_z2_ci.py`).
- `exp_a_wdd.py` and `exp_d_provenance.py` also write per-token residuals (`exp_a_tokens.npz`, `exp_d_tokens.npz`) so the GPT-2 sparsity sweep and the provenance null can be read on typical states; their JSON outputs are unchanged.
- `exp_z6_selected.py`: every atom OMP places in the k = 64 support, scored against the ledger: support composition by atom type, the share of selected MLP atoms that are real writes (|c| at least 5% of the token's largest), their sign agreement and calibration, the coefficient mass on spurious atoms, and a per-token least-squares refit on the three true atoms compared with OMP on the same identified cases.
- `exp_d2_null_noemb.py`: the provenance null of `exp_d_provenance.py` with the embedding rows removed from every dictionary, with per-token residuals (`exp_d2_tokens.npz`).
- `exp_x5b_energy.py`: random block-3 neuron sets matched in write energy to the nine strongest counter-writers, and their cross-entropy cost.
- `exp_z2_recall_by_decile.json`: top-1 recall by magnitude decile of the largest write, deciles defined over all typical-state cases, from the saved per-token records.
- `exp_z2_ci.py` accepts `WDD_N_EVAL` (evaluation sequences) and `WDD_FP32=1` (the 7B rows in float32), used for the precision control (`exp_z2_fp32.json`, tokens in `exp_z2_tokens_fp32/`).
